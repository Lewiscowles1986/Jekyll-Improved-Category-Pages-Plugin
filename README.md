# better-jekyll-category-pages
I Believe a better way of generating category pages for Jekyll

Basically just download or `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/LewisCowles1986/better-jekyll-category-pages` then copy the `_layouts`, `_includes`, and `_plugins` folder contents into the directory of your Jekyll install

(Open to hearing a better way to distribute)
