# Jekyll, Improved category pages

I Believe an improved way of generating category pages for Jekyll

Basically just download or `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/LewisCowles1986/better-jekyll-category-pages` then copy the `_layouts`, `_includes`, and `_plugins` folder contents into the directory of your Jekyll install

(Open to hearing a better way to distribute)

Essentially the reason for this plugin is to add utility to Jekyll, which is an amazing tool, with the right plugins can do even more!
